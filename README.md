# - Goliath V2 -
Goliath V2 is the ultimate networking tool for all of your hacking needs. This is a bit of an older tool I made when I was slightly less experienced in python, hence why the UI isn't great and it says 'Made by Venom and Neuroscopy*' instead of just 'Made by Lunar Team.' Despite it's age, I believe it's still a great tool many people can benefit from.

Neuroscopy* - Neuroscopy is our member, soupcan7's old name. Neuroscopy and soupcan7 are the same people, and in a future update I will change that... whoopsie
